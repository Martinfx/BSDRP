### Forwarding ###
# Enable Zerocopy for bpf (avoid on 10.3: there is a bug somewhere):
net.bpf.zerocopy_enable=1
# Sendmsg() cat't send messages more than maxdgram length.
# Default value causes routing software to fail with OSPF if jumbo frames is turned on.

net.inet.raw.recvspace=16384
# Bump net.route.netisr_maxqlen to 2048 or higher value
net.route.netisr_maxqlen=2048
# Increasing bpf perfs (since 11.0)
net.bpf.optimize_writers=1

# Do not send IP redirects (enable fastforwarding path)
net.inet.ip.redirect=0
net.inet6.ip6.redirect=0

# Current CPU can manage a lot's more of interrupts than default (1000)
# The 9000 value was found in /usr/src/sys/dev/ixgbe/README
hw.intr_storm_threshold=9000
# TCP Segmentation Offload (TSO) need to be disabled on a router & firewall
# avoid to issue -tso for each NIC
net.inet.tcp.tso=0

### Polling ###
# Improve a lot's the polling performance
# Enable idle_poll
#kern.polling.idle_poll=1
# The default value of 150 was for FastEthernet:
#kern.polling.burst_max=20000
#kern.polling.each_burst=50
# For a router, don't need to share 50/50 with user process
#kern.polling.user_frac=30

### Security ###
# blackhole(8)
# Disable this feature because prevent traceroute to works correctly
#net.inet.tcp.blackhole=2
#net.inet.udp.blackhole=1
# prevent users from seeing information about processes that
# are being run under another UID.
security.bsd.see_other_uids=0

# Prevent some potential exploit
security.bsd.unprivileged_proc_debug=0

# Randomize the PID of newly created processes
# This value need to be randomized on each server
kern.randompid=1543
# Insert stack guard page ahead of the growable segments
# Disabled because mpd5 crash (illegal instruction) with this
#security.bsd.stack_guard_page=512

### Misc ###
# Do not generate core file
kern.coredump=0
# Allow setuid and setgid processes to dump core
kern.sugid_coredump=1
#Power save: Disable power for device with no driver loaded
hw.pci.do_power_nodriver=3
# ICMP reply from incoming interface for non-local packets

# FRR's OSPF daemons need big socket buffers
